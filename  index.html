        <p><em><strong>Still</strong> figuring out what to do with my life</em></p>
        <p> Hello world!. this is my first blog and i'm gonna use it as a kind of diary to talk about myself. So I am from Argentina
          and I'm 23 yo. I just got into coding and I hope in a not so far future I can work of this. I also like sports and videogames
          and videogames about sports. I love music especially BTS and 80s songs, disco, some Lana del Rey (very diverse as u can see)
          I'm also a law student, not really sure if I love it, maybe that's why it's so difficult for me.
          like maybe my brain is not in it idk.

    <li><strong><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/what-do-bts-black-swan-lyrics-mean-in-english-the-message-is-so-deep-19781786">Black Swan-BTS</a></strong>. It's a tribute to Tchaikovsky's song and also the movie. It talks about the <em>first
        death</em> someone goes through when they lost their passion </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong><a href="https://lordsofliteraturekss.wordpress.com/2014/06/29/song-lyrics-analysis-young-and-beautiful-by-lana-del-rey-2/">Young & beautiful- Lana del Rey</a></strong>. It makes me feel nostalgic and reminds me of the passage of time
      and how we all gonna get old and that face, that beauty is gonna be just a memory </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-behind-BTS-Tomorrow">Tomorrow-BTS</a></strong>. A song we can all feel it talks to us. How we sometimes feel stuck and like everyone's moving but
      not us. How everyday feels the same but to not lose hope cause the <em>Tomorrow</em> is gonna be different.</li>
